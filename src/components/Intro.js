					I'm a former electrical engineer turned fullstack developer. I'm
					interested in machine learning, responsive interfaces, and something
					else. Maybe physics-based animation libraries.

					Outside of coding, you can find me reading way too much about
					typefaces or trying to find the perfect cook times for my neapolitan
					pizzas.
