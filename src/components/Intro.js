						I'm a former electrical engineer turned fullstack developer. I'm
						interested in machine learning, responsive interfaces, and something
						else. Maybe physics-based animation libraries.

						Outside of coding, you can find me out on a hike, soldering
						keyboards, or trying to find the perfect hydration level for my
						pizza dough.
